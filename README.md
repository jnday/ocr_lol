# Introduction

Generating an OCR Pipeline from a Hacker News comment

sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit (for nvcc, which is needed by flash-attention2, which is needed by videollama)

pip install
- wand
- ultralytics
- easyocr
- numpy (not really necessary)
- pytesseract (test?)
- transformers (for picture to text)
- accelerate (videollama)
- flash-attn --no-build-isolation (also videollama)
- ffmpeg and decord (you guessed it)

## Prompt

```
Help me create an OCR pipeline from these directions:
 
 
You use an object detection model trained on documents to find the bounding boxes of each document section as images and each bounding box comes with a confidence score for free.
 
You then feed each box of text to a regular OCR model, also giving you a confidence score along with each prediction it makes.
 
You feed each image box into a multimodal model to describe what the image is about.
 
For tables, use a specialist model that does nothing but extract tablesâ€”models like GridFormer
 
You then stitch everything together in an XML file
 
You now have everything extracted with flat XML markup for each category the object detection model knows about, along with multiple types of probability metadata for each bounding box, each letter, and each table cell.
 
You can now start feeding this data programmatically into an LLM to do text processing, where you use the XML to control what parts of the document you send to the LLM.
 
You then get chunking with location data and confidence scores of every part of the document to put as meta data into the RAG store.
```

## Response
```
Creating an OCR pipeline as described involves several sophisticated steps, integrating various machine learning models and data processing techniques. Below is a high-level outline of how you might implement such a pipeline using Python and relevant libraries:
```
### Step 0: Convert PDF to image(s)

1. **Install Imagemagick and do This**: 
    ```sh
    convert -density 300 -channel RGB input/Weick2005.pdf input/weick.jpg
    ```

2. **Or Something Like This**:

    ```python
    from wand.image import Image
    with Image(filename='input/Weick2005.pdf', resolution=300) as img:
        img.colorspace = 'rgb'
        img.save(filename='input/weick.jpg')
    ```

### Step 1: Object Detection for Document Sections

1. **Load Object Detection Model**: Use a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) suitable for detecting document sections.

    ```python
    model = YOLO('yolov8m-doclaynet.pt')
    ```

2. **Detect Document Sections**:
   - Input: Document image.
   - Output: Bounding boxes with confidence scores for each detected section.
   
   ```python
    img = cv2.imread('path/to/your_image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    result = model.predict(img)[0]
    print(result.boxes, result.scores)
   ```

   

### Step 2: OCR on Text Sections

1. **Load OCR Model**: Use a robust OCR library like Tesseract or a deep learning-based OCR model (e.g., EasyOCR).

2. **Extract Text from Bounding Boxes**:
   - Loop through detected text sections and apply OCR.
   - Collect text with confidence scores for each section.

   ```python
   import pytesseract

   for box in text_boxes:
       x, y, w, h = box
       section_image = document_image[y:y+h, x:x+w]
       text_data = pytesseract.image_to_data(section_image, output_type=pytesseract.Output.DICT)
       section_text = text_data['text']
       ocr_confidences = text_data['conf']
   ```

### Step 3: Image Description with Multimodal Model

1. **Load Multimodal Model**: Use a model like CLIP or another multimodal model to describe images.

2. **Describe Image Sections**:
   - Input: Image sections.
   - Output: Descriptions with confidence scores.

   ```python
   multimodal_model = load_multimodal_model()
   for box in image_boxes:
       x, y, w, h = box
       image_section = document_image[y:y+h, x:x+w]
       description, confidence = multimodal_model.describe(image_section)
   ```

### Step 4: Table Extraction

1. **Load Table Extraction Model**: Use a specialized table extraction model like GridFormer.

2. **Extract Tables**:
   - Input: Document image or specific sections.
   - Output: Table data with confidence scores.

   ```python
   table_model = load_table_extraction_model()
   tables = table_model.extract(document_image)
   ```

### Step 5: Stitch Data into XML

1. **Create XML Structure**: Organize extracted data into an XML format.

2. **Add Metadata**:
   - Include bounding box locations, confidence scores, and text data.

   ```python
   from lxml import etree

   root = etree.Element("Document")
   # Add sections with metadata
   for section in sections:
       section_elem = etree.SubElement(root, "Section")
       etree.SubElement(section_elem, "Text").text = section_text
       etree.SubElement(section_elem, "Confidence").text = str(ocr_confidences)

   # Add more elements for images, tables, etc.
   ```

### Step 6: Feed Data to an LLM

1. **Prepare Data for LLM**: Use XML to select specific sections of the document for processing.

2. **Integrate with LLM**: Use an API or library like OpenAI's GPT to process text.

   ```python
   # Example pseudo-code for LLM interaction
   llm_response = llm_model.process(xml_data)
   ```

### Step 7: Store Metadata in RAG

1. **Organize for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - Structure data with metadata for efficient retrieval and processing.

2. **Store in RAG System**:
   - Metadata includes confidence scores, text, location information.

   ```python
   rag_store = RAGStore()
   rag_store.store(xml_with_metadata)
   ```

### Tools and Libraries:
- Object Detection: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Detectron2.
- OCR: Tesseract, EasyOCR.
- Multimodal Models: CLIP, Hugging Face Transformers.
- Table Extraction: GridFormer or similar.
- XML Processing: `lxml` or `xml.etree.ElementTree`.
- LLM Integration: OpenAI API, Transformers library.

This pipeline provides a comprehensive approach to document analysis, leveraging both traditional and advanced machine learning techniques to extract, organize, and utilize document data effectively.
